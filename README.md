# Auto Deploy the Nanome Plugin Starter Pack

A quick script to deploy the Nanome plugin starter pack

## Nanome Plugin Starter Pack Deployment Instructions

In order to successfully complete the deployment of Nanomeâ€™s starter pack group of plugins, you will need to verify that your license is Stack Enabled and you have the Stack Configuration details in-hand (consists of an IP address and a port). 

For Non-Enterprise Customers, please verify that your Nanome Licenses are Plugin Enabled with your Nanome representative.

As of March 17, 2020 - the plugins a part of the starter pack are:

- Chemical Properties - cheminformatics calculation using RDKit
- Docking - using Smina software
- Real-Time Atom Scoring - using DSX software
- RMSD - structural alignment
- Structure Prep - re-calculate bonds and ribbons for Quest users
- Vault - web-based file management (perfect for Quest)

### Step 1: Provisioning the Dedicated Plugins Virtual Machine

Specifications:
Amazon AWS T2.medium EC2 Linux machine with 30 GB of disk storage or equivalent

Equivalent

- A Linux based operation system (Ubuntu or CentOS)
- 2 CPU - equiv. to an Intel Broadwell E5-2686v4 or higher
- 4GB of RAM
- 30GB of Storage space

### Step 2: SSH into the VM + Install Git & Docker

SSH into the VM using the IP address and the user

```sh
ssh ec2-user@<ip-address>

sudo yum install git
sudo yum install docker
sudo service docker start
```

### Step 3: Pull the plugin starter pack auto-deploy script and run it

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nanome-ai/plugin-deployer
cd plugin-deployer

sudo ./deploy.sh -a <your Nanome Stack Config IP> -p <your Nanome Stack Config port>
```

NOTE: to add arguments specific to a plugin, append any number of `--plugin <plugin-name> [args]` to the `./deploy.sh` command.

### Step 4: Docker Container Health Check

Now check to make sure all the docker containers are working properly

```sh
docker ps
```

This should list out the plugins that are currently running. Please verify that none of the containers in the column labeled 'X' has a "restarting (x sec)".

### Step 5: Validate the connection from the VR client

Go ahead and log onto the VR client computer and launch Nanome

\*Note the VR Client computer and the dedicated Plugins VM need to be a part of the same IT firewall network
